# VetCare
## Because your pet is a member of your family!

VetCare was created to address the need to prevent pets, especially dogs, from being abandoned on the streets due to the high costs associated with their care. Research shows that 40% of Colombian families have some kind of pet in their home. Additionally, there is a significant number of stray dogs in need of assistance. Recent studies from La Salle University reveal that for every 100 dogs living with a family in Bogotá, Colombia, there are 38 stray dogs. And what about cats or other pets? This number can rapidly increase. But what is the reason behind so many dogs being left on the streets?
For many people, when they realize how expensive it is to care for a pet, they simply decide to abandon them, without considering how painful this can be for the animal. On top of that, many of these stray dogs are not neutered, leading to the overpopulation of street dogs.
VetCare will offer affordable prices for customers, helping Colombian citizens save hundreds of thousands of pesos in pet care costs, while also contributing to the control and improvement of the well-being of abandoned pets, particularly dogs.
VetCare is the solution for Colombian pet owners who feel forced to abandon their pets due to financial constraints, especially given the high costs of pet care in the country. Moreover, VetCare is dedicated to rescuing pets that have been abandoned and providing them with completely free treatment for any health issues they are facing.

## CHOSEN THEME
The chosen theme for this project  can be E-commerce & Health 

## OBJECTIVES
- Affordable Veterinary Care: Provide affordable medical care to pets, helping Colombian pet owners avoid abandonment due to high veterinary costs.
- Pet Rescue and Treatment: Rescue abandoned pets and offer them free medical care to improve their health and quality of life.
- User-Friendly Platform: Develop a user-centric platform that allows pet owners to easily manage their pets' information and schedule veterinary appointments.
- Health & E-Commerce Integration: Combine healthcare services with e-commerce functionality for booking appointments and purchasing related products or services online.
- Increase Awareness: Raise awareness about responsible pet ownership and the importance of neutering to control overpopulation.

## PROJECT SCOPE
VetCare will provide a digital platform for pet owners to manage their pets and schedule appointments with veterinarians. It will also serve as a tool for rescuing and treating stray pets. The scope includes:

- User Profile Management: Registered users can update their personal details, manage pet profiles, and view scheduled appointments.
- Pet Management: Users can add, update, or remove pets from their profile, providing detailed information such as breed, age, and medical history.
- Appointment Booking: Users can book veterinary appointments for their pets by selecting available time slots, providing information on the reason for the appointment, and receiving confirmation.
- Pet Rescue: Integration of a rescue feature to track and provide free treatment to stray pets.
